PROSECODE
=========

by Don Sheehy

The Vision
----------

The `prosecode` Python library was written to support a literate programming workflow.
It allows one to take markdown files with fenced code blocks and execute the code in the blocks.
Then, the code blocks are tangled out into separate files of pure source code.
Moreover, the markdown files can be converted into high quality LaTeX.

Not all of these features are currently implemented in `prosecode`.
All of these features are implemented in one form or another by other tools.
Cobbling these tools together resulted in lackluster results so I decided to write my own.
