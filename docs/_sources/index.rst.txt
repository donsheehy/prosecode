prosecode
=========

by Don Sheehy

The `prosecode` Python library was written to support a literate programming workflow.
It allows one to take markdown files with fenced code blocks and execute the code in the blocks.
Then, the code blocks are tangled out into separate files of pure source code.
Moreover, the markdown files are converted into LaTeX.

`prosecode` was written primarily as a way to build the book **A First Course on Data Structures in Python**.
This open source textbook can be found at `<https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/>`_.
